//! Load and render SVG images into Cairo surfaces.
//!
//! This crate can load SVG images and render them to Cairo surfaces,
//! using a mixture of SVG's [static mode] and [secure static mode].
//! Librsvg does not do animation nor scripting, and can load
//! references to external data only in some situations; see below.
//!
//! Librsvg supports reading [SVG 1.1] data, and is gradually adding
//! support for features in [SVG 2].  Librsvg also supports SVGZ
//! files, which are just an SVG stream compressed with the GZIP
//! algorithm.
//!
//! # Basic usage
//!
//! * Create a [`Loader`] struct.
//! * Get an [`SvgHandle`] from the [`Loader`].
//! * Get a [`CairoRenderer`] from the [`SvgHandle`] and render to a Cairo context.
//!
//! [`Loader`]: struct.Loader.html
//! [`SvgHandle`]: struct.SvgHandle.html
//! [`CairoRenderer`]: struct.CairoRenderer.html
//!
//! # The "base file" and resolving references to external files
//!
//! When you load an SVG, librsvg needs to know the location of the "base file"
//! for it.  This is so that librsvg can determine the location of referenced
//! entities.  For example, say you have an SVG in <filename>/foo/bar/foo.svg</filename>
//! and that it has an image element like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! <image href="resources/foo.png" .../>
//! ```
//!
//! In this case, librsvg needs to know the location of the toplevel
//! `/foo/bar/foo.svg` so that it can generate the appropriate
//! reference to `/foo/bar/resources/foo.png`.
//!
//! ## Security and locations of referenced files
//!
//! When processing an SVG, librsvg will only load referenced files if
//! they are in the same directory as the base file, or in a
//! subdirectory of it.  That is, if the base file is
//! `/foo/bar/baz.svg`, then librsvg will only try to load referenced
//! files (from SVG's `<image>` element, for example, or from content
//! included through XML entities) if those files are in `/foo/bar/*`
//! or in `/foo/bar/*/.../*`.  This is so that malicious SVG files
//! cannot include files that are in a directory above.
//!
//! The full set of rules for deciding which URLs may be loaded is as follows;
//! they are applied in order.  A referenced URL will not be loaded as soon as
//! one of these rules fails:
//!
//! 1. All `data:` URLs may be loaded.  These are sometimes used to
//! include raster image data, encoded as base-64, directly in an SVG
//! file.
//!
//! 2. All other URL schemes in references require a base URL.  For
//! example, this means that if you load an SVG with
//! [`Loader.read`](struct.Loader.html#method.read) without
//! providing a `base_url`, then any referenced files will not be
//! allowed (e.g. raster images to be loaded from other files will not
//! work).
//!
//! 3. If referenced URLs are absolute, rather than relative, then
//! they must have the same scheme as the base URL.  For example, if
//! the base URL has a "`file`" scheme, then all URL references inside
//! the SVG must also have the "`file`" scheme, or be relative
//! references which will be resolved against the base URL.
//!
//! 4. If referenced URLs have a "`resource`" scheme, that is, if they
//! are included into your binary program with GLib's resource
//! mechanism, they are allowed to be loaded (provided that the base
//! URL is also a "`resource`", per the previous rule).
//!
//! 5. Otherwise, non-`file` schemes are not allowed.  For example,
//! librsvg will not load `http` resources, to keep malicious SVG data
//! from "phoning home".
//!
//! 6. A relative URL must resolve to the same directory as the base
//! URL, or to one of its subdirectories.  Librsvg will canonicalize
//! filenames, by removing "`..`" path components and resolving symbolic
//! links, to decide whether files meet these conditions.
