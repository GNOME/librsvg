    <!-- Explanation of the transform above:

         The bug is about text-anchor="middle" not working properly when there is a
         transform with scaling.

         So, we create a transform with horizontal scaling 2, and vertical scaling 3.
         Then we translate by 100 pixels horizontally (200/2 of the viewBox width), and
         136 pixels vertically, because of the following:

         In the Ahem font, each glyph is a square - https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/ahem.html

         The ascent above the baseline is 0.8em, and the descent below the baseline
         is 0.2em.  So, at font-size=40 it means the top is 0.8*40 = 32 units above the baseline.  Since
         the vertical scaling factor is 3, we translate by 32*3=96 pixels in the Y axis, plus an additional
         (200 - (40 * 3)) / 2 = 40 pixels, thus adding up to the 136 pixels in the transform above.

         The vertical translation will center the glyph vertically in the available space.

         The bug is about the glyph not being horizontally centered in the available space.
