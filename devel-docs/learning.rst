Learning resources
==================

Like any other part of the web platform, SVG is a bit fractally
complex.  There is the SVG format itself, its drawing model, text
layout, font rendering, image compositing, and a bunch of fascinating
topics.  This chapter has links to various places where you can learn
about these topics.



The SVG format
--------------

`SVG Tutorial as an advent calendar <https://svg-tutorial.com/>`__ —
24 short lessons to learn basic SVG features.

`Blind SVG <https://blindsvg.com/>`__ — This is the absolute best
guide I have found for learning the SVG format gradually.  It is
designed so that blind and low-vision people can learn to write their
own illustrations using SVG, but it is useful for everyone!

`SVG tutorial at Mozilla Developer's Network
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial>`__ —
Detailed and friendly.

`Codepen <https://codepen.io/pen/>`__ — lets you paste SVG code in its
usual HTML editor and see it rendered immediately.  You can also add a
CSS stylesheet to experiment with styles.

The text rendering pipeline
