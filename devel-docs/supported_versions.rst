Only these versions are supported:

reporting bugs or missing features.

Policy for supported versions
-----------------------------

At any one time, we support the latest stable version stream and the
``main`` development branch.  At the discretion of the maintainer, the
previous stable version stream may also be supported.

You can see the :doc:`security` chapter for information about versions
with security fixes.
