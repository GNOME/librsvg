Supported versions
==================

Only these versions are supported:

* 2.60.x
* 2.61.x

Older versions are not supported.  Please try a newer version before
reporting bugs or missing features.

Policy for supported versions
-----------------------------

At any one time, we support the latest stable version stream and the
``main`` development branch.  At the discretion of the maintainer, the
previous stable version stream may also be supported.

You can see the :doc:`security` chapter for information about versions
with security fixes.

Stable release streams
----------------------

Starting with librsvg 2.55.x, all subsequent release streams are
considered stable.  Before that, release streams with an even minor
version (e.g. 2.54.x) were stable, and ones with an odd minor version
(2.53.x) were unstable.  So, these are all stable now:

* 2.55.x
* 2.56.x
* 2.57.x
* etc.

Development releases
--------------------

Versions whose micro component is 90 or greater (e.g. 2.59.90) are
considered development or beta versions before the next stable release
stream.  For example, 2.59.90 is the first beta before the 2.60.0
stable release.
