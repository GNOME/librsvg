Architecture
============

This document roughly describes the architecture of librsvg, and future
plans for it. The code is continually evolving, so don’t consider this
as the ground truth, but rather like a cheap map you buy at a street
corner.

The library’s internals are documented as Rust documentation comments;
you can look at the rendered version at
https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/index.html

You may also want to see the section below on `interesting parts of the
code <#some-interesting-parts-of-the-code>`__.

A bit of history
----------------

Librsvg is an old library. It started around 2001, when Eazel (the
original makers of GNOME’s file manager Nautilus) needed a library to
render SVG images. At that time the SVG format was being standardized,
so librsvg grew along with the SVG specification. This is why you will
sometimes see references to deprecated SVG features in the source code.

Librsvg started as an experiment to use libxml2’s new SAX parser, so
that SVG could be streamed in and rendered on the fly, instead of first
creating a DOM tree. Originally it used
`libart <https://levien.com/libart/>`__ as a rendering library; this was
GNOME’s first antialiased renderer with alpha compositing. Later, the
renderer was replaced with `Cairo <https://www.cairographics.org/>`__.
Librsvg is currently striving to support other rendering backends.

These days librsvg indeed builds a DOM tree by itself; it needs the
tree to run the CSS cascade, do selector matching, and to support
cross-element references like in SVG filters.

Librsvg started as a C library with an ad-hoc API. At some point it
got turned into a GObject library, so that the main `RsvgHandle
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/librsvg_c/handle/struct.RsvgHandle.html>`_
class defines most of the entry points into the library. Through
`GObject Introspection <https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__, this
allows librsvg to be used from other programming languages.

In 2016, librsvg started getting ported to Rust. As of early 2021, the
whole library is implemented in Rust, and exports an intact C API/ABI.
It also exports a more idiomatic Rust API as well.

The C and Rust APIs
-------------------

Librsvg exports two public APIs, one for C and one for Rust.

The C API has hard requirements for API/ABI stability, because it is
used all over the GNOME project and API/ABI breaks would be highly
disruptive. Also, the C API is what allows librsvg to be called from
other programming languages, through `GObject
Introspection <https://gi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

The Rust API is a bit more lax in its API stability, but we try to stick
to `semantic versioning <https://semver.org/>`__ as is common in Rust.

The public Rust API is implemented in `src/api.rs
<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/main/rsvg/src/api.rs>`_. This
has all the primitives needed to load and render SVG documents or
individual elements, and to configure loading/rendering options.

The public C API is implemented in `librsvg-c/src
<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/tree/main/librsvg-c/src>`_, and
it is implemented in terms of the public Rust API. Note that as of
2021/Feb the corresponding C header files are hand-written in
`include/librsvg/
<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/tree/main/include/librsvg>`_;
maybe in the future they will be generated automatically with
`cbindgen <https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen/blob/master/docs.md>`__.

We consider it good practice to provide simple and clean primitives in
the Rust API, and have ``librsvg-c`` deal with all the idiosyncrasies and
historical considerations for the C API.

In short: the public C API calls the public Rust API, and the public
Rust API calls into the library's internals.

The test suite
--------------

The test suite is documented in `rsvg/tests/README.md
<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/librsvg/-/blob/main/rsvg/tests/README.md>`_.

Code flow
---------

The caller of librsvg loads a document into a handle, and later may ask
to render the document or one of its elements, or measure their
geometries.

Loading an SVG document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Rust API starts by constructing an `SvgHandle
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/api/struct.SvgHandle.html>`_
from a `Loader
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/api/struct.Loader.html>`_;
both of those are public types. Internally the ``SvgHandle`` is just a
wrapper around a `Document
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/document/struct.Document.html>`_,
which is a private type that stores an SVG document loaded in memory.
``SvgHandle`` and its companion `CairoRenderer
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/api/struct.CairoRenderer.html>`_
provide the basic primitive operations like “render the whole
document” or “compute the geometry of an element” that are needed to
implement the public APIs.

A ``Document`` gets created by loading XML from a stream, into a tree
of `Node
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/node/type.Node.html>`_
structures.  This is similar to a web browser’s DOM tree.  ``Node`` is
just a type alias for ``rctree::Node<NodeData>``: an ``rctree`` is an
N-ary tree of reference-counted nodes, and `NodeData
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/node/enum.NodeData.html#>`_
is the enum that librsvg uses to represent either XML element nodes, or
text nodes in the XML.

Each XML element causes a new ``Node`` to get created with a
``NodeData::Element(e)``.  The ``e`` is an `Element
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/element/struct.Element.html>`_,
which is a struct that holds an XML element's name and its attributes.
It also contains an ``element_data`` field, which is an `ElementData
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/element/enum.ElementData.html>`_:
an enum that can represent all the SVG element types.  For example, a
``<path>`` element from XML gets turned into a ``NodeData::Element(e)`` that has
its ``element_data`` set to ``ElementData::Path``.

When an ``Element`` is created from its corresponding XML, its
`Attributes
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/xml/attributes/struct.Attributes.html>`_
get parsed. On one hand, attributes that are specific to a particular
element type, like the ``d`` in ``<path d="...">`` get parsed by the
`set_attributes
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/element/trait.ElementTrait.html#method.set_attributes>`_
method of each particular element type (in that case,
`Path::set_attributes
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/element/trait.ElementTrait.html#method.set_attributes>`_).

On the other hand, attributes that refer to styles, and which may
appear for any kind of element, get all parsed into a `SpecifiedValues
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/properties/struct.SpecifiedValues.html>`_
struct. This is a memory-efficient representation of the CSS style
properties that an element has.

When the XML document is fully parsed, a ``Document`` contains a tree of
``Node`` structs and their inner ``Element`` structs. The tree has also
been validated to ensure that the root is an ``<svg>`` element.

After that, the CSS cascade step gets run.

The CSS cascade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each ``Element`` has a `SpecifiedValues
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/properties/struct.SpecifiedValues.html>`_,
which has the CSS style properties that the XML specified for that
element. However, ``SpecifiedValues`` is sparse, as not all the
possible style properties may have been filled in. Cascading means
following the CSS/SVG rules for each property type to inherit missing
properties from parent elements.  For example, in this document
fragment:

::

   <g stroke-width="2" stroke="black">
     <path d="M0,0 L10,0" fill="blue"/>
     <path d="M20,0 L30,0" fill="green"/>
   </g>

Each ``<path>`` element has a different fill color, but they both
*inherit* the ``stroke-width`` and ``stroke`` values from their parent
group. This is because both the ``stroke-width`` and ``stroke``
properties are defined in the CSS/SVG specifications to inherit
automatically. Some other properties, like ``opacity``, do not inherit
and are thus not copied to child elements.

In librsvg, the individual types for CSS properties are defined with
the ``make_property`` macro.

The cascading step takes each element’s ``SpecifiedValues`` and
composes it by CSS inheritance onto a `ComputedValues
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/properties/struct.ComputedValues.html>`_,
which has the result of the cascade for each element's properties.

When cascading is done, each ``Element`` has a fully resolved
``ComputedValues`` struct, which is what gets used during rendering to
look up things like the element’s stroke width or fill color.

Parsing XML into a tree of Nodes / Elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Librsvg uses an XML parser (`libxml2
<https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/wikis/home>`_ at the time of
this writing) to do the first-stage parsing of the SVG
document. `XmlState
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/xml/struct.XmlState.html>`_
contains the XML parsing state, which is a stack of contexts depending
on the XML nesting structure. ``XmlState`` has public methods, called
from the XML parser as it goes. The most important one is
`start_element
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/xml/struct.XmlState.html#method.start_element>`_;
this is responsible for creating new ``Node`` structures in the tree,
within the `DocumentBuilder
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/document/struct.DocumentBuilder.html>`_
being built.

Nodes are either SVG elements (the `Element
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/element/struct.Element.html>`_
struct), or text data inside elements (the `Chars
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/text/struct.Chars.html>`_
struct); this last one will not concern us here, and we will only talk
about ``Element``.

Each supported kind of ``Element`` parses its attributes in a
`set_attributes
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/element/trait.ElementTrait.html#method.set_attributes>`_
method. Each attribute is just a key/value pair; for example, the
``<rect width="5px">`` element has a ``width`` attribute whose value
is ``5px``.

While parsing its attributes, an element may encounter an invalid value,
for example, a negative width where only nonnegative ones are allowed.
In this case, the element’s ``set_attributes`` method may return a
``Result::Err``. The caller will then do ``set_error`` to mark that
element as being in an error state. If an element is in error, its
children will get parsed as usual, but the element and its children will
be ignored during the rendering stage.

The SVG spec says that SVG rendering should stop on the first element
that is “in error”. However, most implementations simply seem to ignore
erroneous elements instead of completely stopping rendering, and we do
the same in librsvg.

CSS and styles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Librsvg uses Servo’s `cssparser <https://crates.io/crates/cssparser>`_
crate as a CSS tokenizer, and `selectors
<https://crates.io/crates/selectors>`_ as a high-level parser for CSS
style data.

With the ``cssparser`` crate, the caller is responsible for providing
an implementation of the `DeclarationParser
<https://docs.rs/cssparser/0.29.6/cssparser/trait.DeclarationParser.html>`_
trait. Its `parse_value
<https://docs.rs/cssparser/0.29.6/cssparser/trait.DeclarationParser.html#tymethod.parse_value>`_
method takes the name of a CSS property name like ``fill``, plus a
value like ``rgb(255, 0, 0)``, and it must return a value that
represents a parsed declaration. Librsvg uses the `Declaration
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/css/struct.Declaration.html>`_
struct for this.

The core of parsing CSS is the ``parse_value`` function, which returns
a `ParsedProperty
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/properties/enum.ParsedProperty.html>`_:

.. code:: rust

   pub enum ParsedProperty {
       BaselineShift(SpecifiedValue<BaselineShift>),
       ClipPath(SpecifiedValue<ClipPath>),
       Color(SpecifiedValue<Color>),
       // etc.
   }

What is `SpecifiedValue
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/properties/enum.SpecifiedValue.html>`_?
It is the parsed value for a CSS property directly as it comes out of
the SVG document:

.. code:: rust

   pub enum SpecifiedValue<T>
   where
       T: Property + Clone + Default,
   {
       Unspecified,
       Inherit,
       Specified(T),
   }

A property declaration can look like ``opacity: inherit;`` - this would
create a ``ParsedProperty::Opacity(SpecifiedValue::Inherit)``.

Or it can look like ``opacity: 0.5;`` - this would create a
``ParsedProperty::Opacity(SpecifiedValue::Specified(Opacity(UnitInterval(0.5))))``.
Let’s break this down:

- ``ParsedProperty::Opacity`` - which property did we parse?

- ``SpecifiedValue::Specified`` - it actually was specified by the
  document with a value; the other interesting alternative is
  ``Inherit``, which corresponds to the value ``inherit`` that all CSS
  property declarations can have.

- ``Opacity(UnitInterval(0.5))`` - This is the type `Opacity
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/property_defs/struct.Opacity.html>`_
  property, which is a newtype around an internal `UnitInterval
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/unit_interval/struct.UnitInterval.html>`_
  type, which in turn guarantees that we have a float in the range
  ``[0.0, 1.0]``.

There is a Rust type for every CSS property that librsvg supports; many
of these types are newtypes around primitive types like ``f64``.

Eventually an entire CSS stylesheet, like the contents of a
``<style>`` element, gets parsed into a `Stylesheet
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/css/struct.Stylesheet.html>`_
struct. A stylesheet has a list of rules, where each rule is the CSS
selectors defined for it, and the style declarations that should be
applied for the ``Node``\ s that match the selectors. For example, in
a little stylesheet like this:

.. code:: xml

   <style type="text/css">
     rect, #some_id {
       fill: blue;
       stroke-width: 5px;
     }
   </style>

This stylesheet has a single rule. The rule has a selector list with two
selectors (``rect`` and ``#some_id``) and two style declarations
(``fill: blue`` and ``stroke-width: 5px``).

After parsing is done, there is a **cascading stage** where librsvg
walks the tree of nodes, and for each node it finds the CSS rules that
should be applied to it.

Rendering
---------

The rendering process starts at the `draw_tree()
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/drawing_ctx/fn.draw_tree.html>`_
function. This sets up a `DrawingCtx
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/drawing_ctx/struct.DrawingCtx.html>`_,
which carries around all the mutable state during rendering.

Rendering is a recursive process, which goes back and forth between
the utility functions in ``DrawingCtx`` and the `draw
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/element/trait.ElementTrait.html#method.draw>`_
method in elements.

The main job of ``DrawingCtx`` is to deal with the SVG drawing model.
Each element renders itself independently, and its result gets modified
before getting composited onto the final image:

1. Render an element to a temporary surface (example: stroke and fill a
   path).
2. Apply filter effects (blur, color mapping, etc.).
3. Apply clipping paths.
4. Apply masks.
5. Composite the result onto the final image.

The temporary result from the last step also gets put in a stack; this
is because filter effects sometimes need to look at the currently-drawn
background to apply further filtering to it.

You’ll see that most of the rendering-related functions return a
``Result<BoundingBox, RenderingError>``. Some SVG features require
knowing the bounding box of the object that is being rendered; for
historical reasons this bounding box is computed as part of the
rendering process in librsvg. When computing a subtree’s bounding box,
the bounding boxes from the leaves get aggregated up to the root of
the subtree. Each node in the tree has its own coordinate system;
`BoundingBox
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/bbox/struct.BoundingBox.html>`_
is able to transform coordinate systems to get a bounding box that is
meaningful with respect to the root’s transform.

Comparing floating-point numbers
--------------------------------

Librsvg sometimes needs to compute things like “are these points equal?”
or “did this computed result equal this test reference number?”.

We use ``f64`` numbers in Rust for all computations on real numbers.
Floating-point numbers cannot be compared with ``==`` effectively, since
it doesn’t work when the numbers are slightly different due to numerical
inaccuracies.

Similarly, we don’t ``assert_eq!(a, b)`` for floating-point numbers.

Most of the time we are dealing with coordinates which will get passed
to Cairo. In turn, Cairo converts them from doubles to a fixed-point
representation (as of March 2018, Cairo uses 24.8 fixnums with 24 bits
of integral part and 8 bits of fractional part).

So, we can consider two numbers to be “equal” if they would be
represented as the same fixed-point value by Cairo. Librsvg implements
this in the `ApproxEqCairo
<https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/float_eq_cairo/trait.ApproxEqCairo.html>`_
trait.  You can use it like this:

.. code:: rust

   use float_eq_cairo::ApproxEqCairo; // bring the trait into scope

   let a: f64 = ...;
   let b: f64 = ...;

   if a.approx_eq_cairo(&b) { // not a == b
       ... // equal!
   }

   assert!(1.0_f64.approx_eq_cairo(&1.001953125_f64)); // 1 + 1/512 - cairo rounds to 1

Some interesting parts of the code
----------------------------------

- Are you adding support for a CSS property? Look at the 
  :doc:`adding_a_property` tutorial; look in the `property_defs
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/property_defs/index.html>`_
  and `properties
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/properties/index.html>`_
  modules. ``property_defs`` defines most of the CSS properties that
  librsvg supports, and ``properties`` actually puts all those
  properties in the ``SpecifiedValues`` and ``ComputedValues``
  structs.

- The `DrawingCtx
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/drawing_ctx/struct.DrawingCtx.html>`_
  struct is active while an SVG handle is being drawn. It has all the
  mutable state related to the drawing process, such as the stack of
  temporary rendered surfaces, and the viewport stack.

- The `Document
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/document/struct.Document.html>`_
  struct represents a loaded SVG document. It holds the tree of `Node
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/node/type.Node.html>`_
  structs, some of which contain `Element
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/element/struct.Element.html>`_
  and some other contain `Chars
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/text/struct.Chars.html>`_
  for text data in the XML. A ``Document`` also contains a mapping of
  ``id`` attributes to the corresponding element nodes.

- The `xml
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/xml/index.html>`_
  module receives events from an XML parser, and builds a
  ``Document`` tree.

- The `css
  <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/css/index.html>`_
  module has the high-level machinery for parsing CSS and representing
  parsed stylesheets. The low-level parsers for individual properties
  are in `property_defs <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/property_defs/index.html>`_ and
  `font_props <https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/librsvg/internals/rsvg/font_props/index.html>`_.
