  non-x86_64 platforms (Simon McVittie, Federico Mena).
- Fix #368 - With RSVG_LOG=1, librsvg will now report when SVGs have
  references to nonexistent elements, to aid debugging (for example,
  in an xlink:href attribute).

  breaking the build (Simon McVittie).

Version 2.44.7
- Fix #256 - Correctly match the systemLanguage attribute with the

  elements (Paolo Borelli).
- Fix #325 - All the elements were being leaked at the toplevel.
- Fix #326 - Fix COMPILING.md - librsvg 2.44 does not build on Ubuntu
  18.04 because it has a rust version that is too old.

Version 2.44.0

- Optimizations for Gaussian blur and other filters (Ivan Molodetskikh).
- Optimizations in SRGB <-> linear RGB conversions (Ivan Molodetskikh).

  Molodetskikh's Summer of Code project!!!!!
- We now require Rust 1.26.
- We now include Rust debug information even in release builds, to make it
  easier to obtain stack traces.
- Fix #310 - Respect DPI in the font-size property (Mike Marcacci).
- Fix: draw the circle/ellipse elements with the same orientation as
  the SVG 1.1 test suite; this is relevant for stroke-dasharray (Ivan
  Molodetskikh).
- Refactoring of the drawing code and font sizes (Paolo Borelli).
- New filters in Rust: feConvolveMatrix, feColorMatrix, feMorphology,
  feDisplacementMap, feGaussianBlur, feDistantLight, feSpotLight,

  amount of work! (Paolo Borelli)
- All the style property parsers have been moved to rust-cssparser.

Version 2.43.0
- This is the start of the 2.43 development series, and you bet we are
  doing extensive changes!
- Many, many thanks to Jordan Petridis for keeping our Continuous
  Infrastructure updated all the time, and for emergency fixes when
  they were necessary.
- As part of the Summer of Code 2018, Ivan Molodetskikh is porting the
  filter effects to Rust.  These are done so far:  core filters
  infrastructure, feComposite, feMerge, feOffset.  The only remaining
  SVG elements done in C pertain to filter effects, and Ivan is taking
  care of them.
- The feComposite filter now operates in linear RGB space, for better
  spec compliance.  We transform back to SRGB for the final results
  (see issue #275 for pending work on fully supporting this
  elsewhere).
- Filters now compute their bounds to floating-point values, instead
  of clipping them to integers.
- The text, tspan, tref elements are now in Rust (Paolo Borelli).
- Text rendering should be better.  We now perform text measurement
  operations with the actual affine transformation that the text will
  use in the end.  This should give Pango/Freetype a better chance of
  doing scale-appropriate hinting.
- The basic styling infrastructure has moved to Rust (Paolo Borelli,
  Federico Mena).  We don't use the old and limited cascading code
  anymore.  We also audited which CSS properties are supposed to
  inherit automatically or not; this should be working per the SVG
  spec now.  Special thanks to Paolo for doing the largest part of the
  work in moving the style data to Rust; this was a painstaking,
  months-long process of constant refactoring.
- The internals of the drawing infrastructure and bounding-box
  computation are now done in Rust (Paolo Borelli).
- Element creation from the parsing stage is now in Rust (Saurav
  Sachidanand).
- Clipping and Masking are now done in Rust (Paolo Borelli).
- Our tests now include the full Adwaita icon theme, so it doesn't
  break.
- Fix: #241 - feDistantLight and feSpotLight now work again.
- Fix: #282 - feComposite is fixed not to overwrite the source image
  in some cases; this fixes drop shadows generated from Inkscape (Ivan
  Molodetskikh).
- We have the beginnings of Windows CI, courtesy of Guillaume Gomez.
- Changes from 2.42.4:
- Fix: elements with systemLanguage attributes without variants now
  work better (Paolo Borelli).
- gitlab#227 - Fix: we now catch negative values in stroke-dasharray
  properties instead of leaving the cairo_t in an error state.
- gitlab#228 - Fix: empty transform attribute now correctly yields an
  identity transform (Dmitry Kontsevoy).
- Fix possible crash on invalid gradient references.
- Make robust against patterns and gradients with no children.
- Lots of code cleanups and refactorings (Jordan Petridis, Dmitry
  Kontsevoy, Ivan Molodetskikh).
- Code moved to Rust: low-level path and PangoLayout drawing, "switch"
  element (Paolo Borelli).
- New Rust dependencies: float_cmp, pangocairo crates.
- We now require Rust 1.21 or later.
- Changes from 2.42.5:
- #276 - rsvg_handle_render_cairo() will now refuse to render if the
  cairo_t passed to it is in an error state.  Fixes a panic in the
  cairo-dock program.
- #206 - The test suite now writes test artifacts to tests/output
  instead of /tmp (Saurav Sachidanand).

Version 2.42.3
- gitlab#205 - The configure script now checks for Rust 1.20.0 -
  previously this minimum requirement was not well-defined.
- gitlab#204 - New feature: If an SVG has an <a> link element, we now
  generate the corresponding link when outputting to a Cairo PDF
  surface.  If you use rsvg-convert(1) with PDF output, <a> links in
  the SVG will work in the PDF (Dmitry Kontsevoy).
- gitlab#108 - New feature: support font-size:larger and font-size:smaller
  relative sizes.
- New feature: rsvg-convert now supports SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH per
  https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/ to generate
  reproducible output for PDFs (Chris Lamb).
- gitlab#197 - New requirement: We now require Freetype2 2.9.0, which
  fixes font rendering bugs.  The test reference PNGs have been
  regenerated with this version.  You may see changes in font
  rendering as a result of this updated requirement.
- gitlab#91 - Fix rendering of masks and clips when the initial
  transformation has a translation component (Massimo).
- gitlab#112 - Fix: apply style attributes for all SVG elements, not just
  for the toplevel one.
- gitlab#161 - Fix the marker angle for the last vertex of closed
  paths (Juraj Fiala).
- gitlab#198 - Fix: Make rsvg_pixbuf_from_file() and its derived
  functions work again.  Now we have tests for the whole public API.
- gitlab#143 - Minor optimizations for Gaussian blurs (Timm Bäder).
- gitlab#201 - Minor speedups in the code to parse SVG attributes.
- gitlab#178 - Fix some tests that failed on 32-bit machines.
- COMPILING.md now lists our build dependencies, and has command lines
  which you can use on openSUSE/Fedora/Debian/Ubuntu/MacOS to set up a
  development environment for librsvg (Jordan Petridis, Brion Vibber).
- gitlab#211 - Running the configure script on MacOS now works and
  doesn't try to use -Bsymbolic for linking (Brion Vibber).
- gitlab#In addtion to --enable-debug/--disable-debug to control the Rust
  compilation, now you can use an environment variable
  LIBRSVG_DEBUG=yes / LIBRSVG_DEBUG=no if you wish.
- Code moved to Rust: SVG paint servers (Dmitry Kontsevoy), SVG
  attribute parsing.
- We now use a Cargo workspace internally, to move more things to Rust
  (Jordan Petridis, Chun-wei Fan).
- Special thanks in this release to Jordan Petridis for MAJOR
  improvements to our Continuous Integration infrastructure, the
  repository structure, and updates to the compilation documentation.
  Also for setting up 32-bit builds for continuous integration.

Version 2.42.2
- gitlab#193 - Don't crash when feConvolveMatrix doesn't specify
  orderx/ordery attributes.

- Update rust-cssparser to 0.23 (Igor Gnatenko).

Version 2.42.1
- gitlab#182 - Parse the transform attribute in a faster/simpler way.
  We now use rust-cssparser instead of lalrpop.  This is especially
  noticeable on SVGs with lots of "transform" attributes.
- gitlab#187 - Don't crash when setting a gradient on a zero-sized object.
- gitlab#184 - (Windows) Don't use PangoFT2 if not available (Chun-wei Fan).

  the guidance.
- bgo#761175 - Allow masks and clips to reuse a node being drawn.
- Fix xml:space normalization, per the spec.
- Don't access the file system when deciding whether to load a remote
  file with a UNC path for a paint server (i.e. don't try to load it at all).
- We now support cross-compilation of the Rust code (David Michael).
  See COMPILING.md for details.
- Fixed bugs from Coverity runs (Philip Withnall).
- Vastly improved README.md, new COMPILING.md, improved CONTRIBUTING.md.

- Reference docs now have an overview of the library.
- Distribute README.md in the tarball properly.
- Expanded the test suite.
- Lots of internal refactoring.

Version 2.41.1
- The feConvolveMatrix filter primitive wasn't being rendered at all;
  now it works.
- Pattern specifications can now have a fallback color, per the spec -
  https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/painting.html#SpecifyingPaint
- Tests now use a very basic form of reproducible font rendering.
  This means that "make check" should pass even if you have a custom
  Fontconfig setup.
- Fixed recursive fallbacks in gradients.
- Per the spec, we now don't render elements which have invalid
  attributes.
- Windows build: support building with Fontconfig; support Visual
  Studio 2017; generate .pc files upon install (Chun-wei Fan)
- Fixed bgo#621088 - Text elements can now be used as clipping paths.
- Fixed bgo#587721 - Fix rendering of text elements with transformations
  (Massimo)
- Fixed bgo#776932 - Don't crash on elements with an invalid
  "transform" attribute.
- Fixed bgo#777155 - Ignore patterns that have close-to-zero dimensions.
- Fixed bgo#776297 - Don't render markers for rect / circle elements;
  fix marker angles in some cases (Massimo).
- Fixed bgo#777834 - Don't crash when rendering text with empty
  extents.
- Fixed bgo#634324 - Gaussian blur with negative-scaling
  transformation was being rendered incorrectly.
- Fixed bgo#783835 - Don't divide by zero in Gaussian blurs

  empty.
- Fixed bgo#779489 - Link to pangoft2 as required.
- Don't crash in filters when one of them yields an invalid surface
  for an intermediate result.
- Update for bgo#778666 - Use our own thumbnailer specification file
  (Jeremy Bicha).
- Fixed bgo#782098 - Don't pass deprecated options to gtkdoc-scangobj
  (Ting-Wei Lan).
- Fixed bgo#777833 - Various memory leaks (Philip Withnall, Federico Mena)
- Fixed bgo#786372 - Use the correct default for the style element's
  "type" attribute.
- Fixed bgo#634514 - Don't render unknown elements and their children.
- Fix parsing of "azimuth", "elevation", "limitingConeAngle" for
  filter effects.
- Fixed bgo#785276 - Don't crash on empty or single-byte files.
- Made the <switch> element work; SVG feature names were being
  tested incorrectly.
- Fixed a few cases of uninitialized struct fields.
- Code converted to Rust: preserveAspectRatio attribute, viewBox
  attribute, core Node structure, path/line/rect/circle/ellipse basic
  shapes, group/defs/switch/svg/use/symbol structural elements, pattern element

  propagation from parsers, gradient stops, gradient element, 
- Added a bunch of new test cases for the new features and the
  code converted to Rust.
- We now require cairo-rs 0.2.0
- We now require lalrpop 0.13.1
- The librsvg tarball now comes with the Rust dependencies embedded
  using "cargo vendor".  Linux distros can replace these dependencies
  with their own versions using the infrastructure described in
  http://doc.crates.io/source-replacement.html

Version 2.41.0
- The big news is that parts of librsvg are now implemented in the
  Rust programming language, instead of C.  The public API remains
  identical.  Rust should provide us with memory safety and nicer
  built-in abstractions for the code, as well as an easier way to do
  unit tests.  Special thanks to all the people who sent tips on Rust
  idioms, and to Sebastian Dröge and Hubert Figuière for the Automake bits.
- Added an "--enable-debug" option to configure.ac - this will tell
  the Rust compiler to generate debugging code, instead of working in
  release mode.  Note that you must still pass CFLAGS by hand by the
  regular means for the C code.
- For Windows builds, only MSVC 2012 and upward are supported now.
- Chun-wei Fan made it possible to regenerate the MSVC project files
  when Makefile.am changes.
- Fixed bgo#763386 - handle curveto segments where three control
  points are coincident.  Thanks to Massimo for the detailed test cases.
- Fixed bgo#603550 - Compute the luminance correctly when generating a
  mask.  Thanks to Mike Lewis for the patch.
- Fixed bgo#776297 - Only render markers in path, line, polygon,
  polyline elements.
- Fixed feImage filters when they reference SVG nodes; they were
  translated incorrectly.
- Fixed feComponentTransferFunction when there are duplicated feFuncX
  elements.
- Fixed bgo#761871 - handle reflection points for quadratic and cubic
  curves correctly.
- Fixed bgo#686953 - support the "marker" shorthand property.
- Fixed a few minor issues pointed out by Coverity.
- The path data parser now handles boolean values in Arc elements correctly.
- Fixed conformance bugs in gradient inheritance.
- Radial gradients now adjust the focus point correctly to be within
  the gradient's radius.
- Stroke width normalization is now conformant to the spec.
- Viewport-relative length normalization is now conformant to the spec.
- Added some of the official SVG 1.1 test files to our test suite.  Fixed
  a little bunch of conformance bugs.
- As a small optimization, we only push/pop CSS states when rendering
  will actually happen, instead of for all (potentially invisible) nodes.
- Code that has been converted to Rust:  marker orientations and
  rendering, path data parser, path building, length normalization,
  gradient inheritance, bounding boxes with affine transformations.
- Lots of refactoring to accomodate the Rust code, and general cleanups as well.
- Added tests/README.md with instructions on how to run the test suite
  and update it.
  rsvg-test can now skip files or directories that start with "ignore".
- Improved the README.

Version 2.40.16
- Chun-wei Fan added support for building the introspection files under MSVC.
- Fixed bgo#760262 - Make the zooming options in rsvg-convert(1) work again
  for scaling the resulting image.  Fix by Menner <mix@gmx.org>.
- Fixed bgo#764808 - Wikipedia generates equations as SVGs and renders
  them, but uses fill="currentColor".  Since we don't let callers
  specify a starting state for CSS, we need to start with opaque black
  as the default current color.
- Added documentation for how to replace the deprecated
  rsvg_handle_set_size_callback().

Version 2.40.15
- Apologies for the lack of 2.40.14.  I mistakenly tagged the
  repository before updating the NEWS file.
- librsvg now uses the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, 
  version 1.4, to which all contributors and maintainers are expected
  to abide. Please see the code_of_conduct.md file for details.
- Chun-wei Fan fixed builds on Visual Studio pre-2012.
- Fixed bgo#759084 - Don't crash when filters don't actually exist
  Fix by Benjamin Otte.
- Javier Jardón updated our autogen.sh to use modern autotools.
- Fixed bgo#761728 - Memory leak in the PrimitiveComponentTransfer
  filter.  Fix by Ron Hopper.

Version 2.40.13
- Chun-wei Fan and Paolo Borelli fixed the Windows build.
- Menner added basic support for the "baseline-shift" attribute in
  text objects.  We support "sub", "super", and plain "baseline", so
  you can at least have subscripts and superscripts for formulas and
  such.  There is no support for percentages or explicit lengths yet.
  bgo#340047.
- Menner fixed some duplicate logic when rendering paths, which would
  try to decide whether to create intermediate surfaces.  Now we have
  a single place where this is done.  This fixes inconsistent text
  spacing in some situations.  bgo#749415.
- Rewrote the markers engine, for bgo#685906 and bgo#760180 - Our
  machinery for rendering SVG markers (like arrowheads and such)
  didn't handle several cases correctly.  Curves with coincident
  control points produced incorrect orientations for the markers, as
  did multiple contiguous zero-length segments.  We follow the spec
  for this now and handle things correctly.  Also, markers didn't
  render in the correct position if they had the viewBox attribute
  set.

Version 2.40.12
- Benjamin Otte did *great* work in refactoring the test harness to
  use Glib's gtest infrastructure, instead of using home-grown
  machinery.  Tests can simply be put as SVG files in the tests/
  subdirectories; it is not necessary to list them explicitly in some
  text file.  Yay!
- Gzipped SVGs now work if read from streams.
- References to objects/filters/URIs/etc. are now handled lazily.
  Also, there is a general-purpose cycle detector so malformed SVGs
  don't cause infinite loops.  Work by Benjamin Otte.
- Removed parsing of Adobe blend modes; they were not implemented, anyway.
- Fixed bgo#700911 - feComponentTransfer filter functions did not work at all.
- Fixed bgo#630732 - out-of-bounds read in feComponentTransfer with tableValues.
- Fixed bgo#677068 - incorrect reflection points in paths.

Version 2.40.11
- Add project files for building on Visual Studio (bgo#753555).  Work
  by Chun-wei Fan.
- Added an "--export-id" option to rsvg-convert(1).  This lets you
  select a single object to export, for example, to pick out a group
  from a multi-part drawing.  Note that this is mostly useful for PNG
  output right now; for SVG output we don't preserve many attributes
  which could be useful in the extracted version.  Doing this properly
  requires an internal "output to SVG" backend instead of just telling
  Cairo to render to SVG.

Version 2.40.10
- Fixed bgo#748608 - Memory leak when Gaussian-blurring.  Thanks to
  Carlos Garnacho for fixing my leaky code.
- Fixed bgo#739329 - font-family attributes with singly-quoted names
  were not handled correctly, yielding incorrect fonts.  Patch by Menner.
- Fixed bgo#476507 - Path start/end markers didn't have the correct angle
  if the path was a curve with coincident control points.  Patch by Menner.
- Fixed bgo#688689 - Support font-style="normal" within a non-normal
  styled text block.  Patch by Paolo.
- Fixed builddir != srcdir.  Patch by Matthias Clasen.
- Remove a bunch of deprecated GTK+ calls.
- This version of librsvg requires GTK+ 3.10.0, which is, ahem, only two years old.
  We previously required a version of GTK+ which is four years old.  Out with
  the old, in with the old.

Version 2.40.9
- Fixed bgo#738367 - V/v/H/h commands in path elements were not
  working.  Patch by Andrea Griffini.
- Fixed bgo#605875 - Gaussian-blurred objects were sometimes missing.
  Based on a patch by Eduard Braun.
- Fixed bgo#710163 - use _wfullpath() on Windows when canonicalizing
  filenames.  Patch by LRN.

Version 2.40.8
- Bugs fixed from fuzz testing: #744688 - possible double g_free()
  when processing stroke-dasharray
- Optimize rendering of polylines, lines, rectangles, circles, and
  ellipses.  These should be marginally faster, marginally more
