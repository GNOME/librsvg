Version 2.40.16
- Chun-wei Fan added support for building the introspection files under MSVC.
- Fixed bgo#760262 - Make the zooming options in rsvg-convert(1) work again
  for scaling the resulting image.  Fix by Menner <mix@gmx.org>.
- Fixed bgo#764808 - Wikipedia generates equations as SVGs and renders
  them, but uses fill="currentColor".  Since we don't let callers
  specify a starting state for CSS, we need to start with opaque black
  as the default current color.
- Added documentation for how to replace the deprecated
  rsvg_handle_set_size_callback().

Version 2.40.15
- Apologies for the lack of 2.40.14.  I mistakenly tagged the
  repository before updating the NEWS file.
- librsvg now uses the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, 
  version 1.4, to which all contributors and maintainers are expected
  to abide. Please see the code_of_conduct.md file for details.
- Chun-wei Fan fixed builds on Visual Studio pre-2012.
- Fixed bgo#759084 - Don't crash when filters don't actually exist
  Fix by Benjamin Otte.
- Javier Jardón updated our autogen.sh to use modern autotools.
- Fixed bgo#761728 - Memory leak in the PrimitiveComponentTransfer
  filter.  Fix by Ron Hopper.

Version 2.40.13
- Chun-wei Fan and Paolo Borelli fixed the Windows build.
- Menner added basic support for the "baseline-shift" attribute in
  text objects.  We support "sub", "super", and plain "baseline", so
  you can at least have subscripts and superscripts for formulas and
  such.  There is no support for percentages or explicit lengths yet.
  bgo#340047.
- Menner fixed some duplicate logic when rendering paths, which would
  try to decide whether to create intermediate surfaces.  Now we have
  a single place where this is done.  This fixes inconsistent text
  spacing in some situations.  bgo#749415.
- Rewrote the markers engine, for bgo#685906 and bgo#760180 - Our
  machinery for rendering SVG markers (like arrowheads and such)
  didn't handle several cases correctly.  Curves with coincident
  control points produced incorrect orientations for the markers, as
  did multiple contiguous zero-length segments.  We follow the spec
  for this now and handle things correctly.  Also, markers didn't
  render in the correct position if they had the viewBox attribute
  set.

Version 2.40.12
- Benjamin Otte did *great* work in refactoring the test harness to
  use Glib's gtest infrastructure, instead of using home-grown
  machinery.  Tests can simply be put as SVG files in the tests/
  subdirectories; it is not necessary to list them explicitly in some
  text file.  Yay!
- Gzipped SVGs now work if read from streams.
- References to objects/filters/URIs/etc. are now handled lazily.
  Also, there is a general-purpose cycle detector so malformed SVGs
  don't cause infinite loops.  Work by Benjamin Otte.
- Removed parsing of Adobe blend modes; they were not implemented, anyway.
- Fixed bgo#700911 - feComponentTransfer filter functions did not work at all.
- Fixed bgo#630732 - out-of-bounds read in feComponentTransfer with tableValues.
- Fixed bgo#677068 - incorrect reflection points in paths.

Version 2.40.11
- Add project files for building on Visual Studio (bgo#753555).  Work
  by Chun-wei Fan.
- Added an "--export-id" option to rsvg-convert(1).  This lets you
  select a single object to export, for example, to pick out a group
  from a multi-part drawing.  Note that this is mostly useful for PNG
  output right now; for SVG output we don't preserve many attributes
  which could be useful in the extracted version.  Doing this properly
  requires an internal "output to SVG" backend instead of just telling
  Cairo to render to SVG.

Version 2.40.10
- Fixed bgo#748608 - Memory leak when Gaussian-blurring.  Thanks to
  Carlos Garnacho for fixing my leaky code.
- Fixed bgo#739329 - font-family attributes with singly-quoted names
  were not handled correctly, yielding incorrect fonts.  Patch by Menner.
- Fixed bgo#476507 - Path start/end markers didn't have the correct angle
  if the path was a curve with coincident control points.  Patch by Menner.
- Fixed bgo#688689 - Support font-style="normal" within a non-normal
  styled text block.  Patch by Paolo.
- Fixed builddir != srcdir.  Patch by Matthias Clasen.
- Remove a bunch of deprecated GTK+ calls.
- This version of librsvg requires GTK+ 3.10.0, which is, ahem, only two years old.
  We previously required a version of GTK+ which is four years old.  Out with
  the old, in with the old.

Version 2.40.9
- Fixed bgo#738367 - V/v/H/h commands in path elements were not
  working.  Patch by Andrea Griffini.
- Fixed bgo#605875 - Gaussian-blurred objects were sometimes missing.
  Based on a patch by Eduard Braun.
- Fixed bgo#710163 - use _wfullpath() on Windows when canonicalizing
  filenames.  Patch by LRN.

Version 2.40.8
- Bugs fixed from fuzz testing: #744688 - possible double g_free()
  when processing stroke-dasharray
- Optimize rendering of polylines, lines, rectangles, circles, and
  ellipses.  These should be marginally faster, marginally more
  precise, and should put less pressure on the memory allocator.

Version 2.40.7
- Bugs fixed from fuzz testing: #703102, #738050, #738169, #744270, #744299

  had an integer multiplication overflow.
