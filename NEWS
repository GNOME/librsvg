Version 2.40.23
- Apply styles at the end of parsing. This way, styles defined
  further down the document will apply to nodes earlier on, like
  other SVG parsing engines do to.
  The downside to this is increased memory consumption due to having
  to keep the xml attributes of each node in memory.

Version 2.40.22
- Fixed parsing of arc flags in paths. The arc command has two flags
  next to eachother and they don't have to be seperated by spaces,
  which the code previously didn't handle.

- Removed remnants from libxml2s SAX1 parser. We weren't actually
  using it and some environments have dropped support for it.

- #599 - Convert pango layout to paths before drawing, to work
  arround a pango regression (pango#520) that causes it to improperly
  render pango layouts in cairo contexts with a CTM that has non
  uniform scaling factors.

- Moved rsvg.h into librsvg/rsvg.h to match real-world include
  behaviour.

- Added meson buildsystem support for librsvg and libcroco

Version 2.40.21
- CVE-2019-20446 - Backport the following fixes from 2.46.x:

- #515 - Librsvg now has limits on the number of loaded XML elements,
  and the number of referenced elements within an SVG document.  This
  is to mitigate malicious SVGs which try to consume all memory, and
  those which try to consume an exponential amount of CPU time.

- #308 - Fix stack exhaustion with circular references in <use> elements.

- #323 - Fix a denial-of-service condition from exponential explosion
  of rendered elements, through nested use of SVG "use" elements in
  malicious SVGs.  This is similar to the XML "billion laughs attack"
  but for SVG instancing.

Version 2.40.20
- Except for emergencies, this will be the LAST RELEASE of the
  librsvg-2.40.x series.  We are moving to 2.41, which is vastly
  improved over the 2.40 series.  The API/ABI there remain unchaged,
  so we strongly encourage you to upgrade your sources and binaries to
  librsvg-2.41.x.
- bgo#761175 - Allow masks and clips to reuse a node being drawn.
- Don't access the file system when deciding whether to load a remote
  file with a UNC path for a paint server (i.e. don't try to load it at all).
- Vistual Studio: fixed and integrated introspection builds, so
  introspection data is built directly from the Visual Studio project
  (Chun-wei Fan).
- Visual Studio: We now use HIGHENTROPYVA linker option on x64 builds,
  to enhance the security of built binaries (Chun-wei Fan).
- Fix generation of Vala bindings when compiling in read-only source
  directories (Emmanuele Bassi).

Version 2.40.19
- bgo#621088: Using text objects as clipping paths is now supported.
- bgo#587721: Fix rendering of text elements with transformations (Massimo).
- bgo#777833 - Fix memory leaks when an RsvgHandle is disposed before
  being closed (Philip Withnall).
- bgo#782098 - Don't pass deprecated options to gtk-doc (Ting-Wei Lan).
- bgo#786372 - Fix the default for the "type" attribute of the <style> element.
- bgo#785276 - Don't crash on single-byte files.
- bgo#634514: Don't render unknown elements and their sub-elements.
- bgo#777155 - Ignore patterns that have close-to-zero dimensions.
- bgo#634324 - Fix Gaussian blurs with negative scaling.
- Fix the <switch> element; it wasn't working at all.
- Fix loading when rsvg_handle_write() is called one byte at a time.
- bgo#787895 - Fix incorrect usage of libxml2.  Thanks to Nick Wellnhofer
  for advice on this.
- Backported the test suite machinery from the master branch (Chun-wei Fan,
  Federico Mena).
- We now require Pango 1.38.0 or later (released in 2015).
- We now require libxml2 2.9.0 or later (released in 2012).

Version 2.40.18
- bgo#783835 - CVE-2017-11464 - Fix division-by-zero in the Gaussian
  blur code.
- Fix other cases of division-by-zero on fuzzed SVG files.
- Don't crash on invalid transformation matrices.
- Support Visual Studio 2017; generate .pc files for Meson on Windows -
  Chun-wei Fan.

Version 2.40.17
- bgo#778666 - Use our own thumbnailer specification file, so
  gnome-desktop-thumbnailer can generate thumbnails outside of the
  calling process (Jeremy Bicha).
- Removed some redundant code.
- Windows build fixes - Chun-wei Fan.

Version 2.40.16
- Chun-wei Fan added support for building the introspection files under MSVC.
- Fixed bgo#760262 - Make the zooming options in rsvg-convert(1) work again
  for scaling the resulting image.  Fix by Menner <mix@gmx.org>.
- Fixed bgo#764808 - Wikipedia generates equations as SVGs and renders
  them, but uses fill="currentColor".  Since we don't let callers
  specify a starting state for CSS, we need to start with opaque black
  as the default current color.
- Added documentation for how to replace the deprecated
  rsvg_handle_set_size_callback().

Version 2.40.15
- Apologies for the lack of 2.40.14.  I mistakenly tagged the
  repository before updating the NEWS file.
- librsvg now uses the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, 
  version 1.4, to which all contributors and maintainers are expected
  to abide. Please see the code_of_conduct.md file for details.
- Chun-wei Fan fixed builds on Visual Studio pre-2012.
- Fixed bgo#759084 - Don't crash when filters don't actually exist
  Fix by Benjamin Otte.
- Javier Jard√≥n updated our autogen.sh to use modern autotools.
- Fixed bgo#761728 - Memory leak in the PrimitiveComponentTransfer
  filter.  Fix by Ron Hopper.

Version 2.40.13
- Chun-wei Fan and Paolo Borelli fixed the Windows build.
- Menner added basic support for the "baseline-shift" attribute in
  text objects.  We support "sub", "super", and plain "baseline", so
  you can at least have subscripts and superscripts for formulas and
  such.  There is no support for percentages or explicit lengths yet.
  bgo#340047.
- Menner fixed some duplicate logic when rendering paths, which would
  try to decide whether to create intermediate surfaces.  Now we have
  a single place where this is done.  This fixes inconsistent text
  spacing in some situations.  bgo#749415.
- Rewrote the markers engine, for bgo#685906 and bgo#760180 - Our
  machinery for rendering SVG markers (like arrowheads and such)
  didn't handle several cases correctly.  Curves with coincident
  control points produced incorrect orientations for the markers, as
  did multiple contiguous zero-length segments.  We follow the spec
  for this now and handle things correctly.  Also, markers didn't
  render in the correct position if they had the viewBox attribute
  set.

Version 2.40.12
- Benjamin Otte did *great* work in refactoring the test harness to
  use Glib's gtest infrastructure, instead of using home-grown
  machinery.  Tests can simply be put as SVG files in the tests/
  subdirectories; it is not necessary to list them explicitly in some
  text file.  Yay!
- Gzipped SVGs now work if read from streams.
- References to objects/filters/URIs/etc. are now handled lazily.
  Also, there is a general-purpose cycle detector so malformed SVGs
  don't cause infinite loops.  Work by Benjamin Otte.
- Removed parsing of Adobe blend modes; they were not implemented, anyway.
- Fixed bgo#700911 - feComponentTransfer filter functions did not work at all.
- Fixed bgo#630732 - out-of-bounds read in feComponentTransfer with tableValues.
- Fixed bgo#677068 - incorrect reflection points in paths.

Version 2.40.11
- Add project files for building on Visual Studio (bgo#753555).  Work
  by Chun-wei Fan.
- Added an "--export-id" option to rsvg-convert(1).  This lets you
  select a single object to export, for example, to pick out a group
  from a multi-part drawing.  Note that this is mostly useful for PNG
  output right now; for SVG output we don't preserve many attributes
  which could be useful in the extracted version.  Doing this properly
  requires an internal "output to SVG" backend instead of just telling
  Cairo to render to SVG.

Version 2.40.10
- Fixed bgo#748608 - Memory leak when Gaussian-blurring.  Thanks to
  Carlos Garnacho for fixing my leaky code.
- Fixed bgo#739329 - font-family attributes with singly-quoted names
  were not handled correctly, yielding incorrect fonts.  Patch by Menner.
- Fixed bgo#476507 - Path start/end markers didn't have the correct angle
  if the path was a curve with coincident control points.  Patch by Menner.
- Fixed bgo#688689 - Support font-style="normal" within a non-normal
  styled text block.  Patch by Paolo.
- Fixed builddir != srcdir.  Patch by Matthias Clasen.
- Remove a bunch of deprecated GTK+ calls.
- This version of librsvg requires GTK+ 3.10.0, which is, ahem, only two years old.
  We previously required a version of GTK+ which is four years old.  Out with
  the old, in with the old.

Version 2.40.9
- Fixed bgo#738367 - V/v/H/h commands in path elements were not
  working.  Patch by Andrea Griffini.
- Fixed bgo#605875 - Gaussian-blurred objects were sometimes missing.
  Based on a patch by Eduard Braun.
- Fixed bgo#710163 - use _wfullpath() on Windows when canonicalizing
  filenames.  Patch by LRN.

Version 2.40.8
- Bugs fixed from fuzz testing: #744688 - possible double g_free()
  when processing stroke-dasharray
- Optimize rendering of polylines, lines, rectangles, circles, and
  ellipses.  These should be marginally faster, marginally more
  precise, and should put less pressure on the memory allocator.

Version 2.40.7
- Bugs fixed from fuzz testing: #703102, #738050, #738169, #744270, #744299
