# IMPORTANT: If you add/remove/update dependencies here, please also
# update Cargo.toml in https://gitlab.com/BuildStream/cargo-fetcher
# (just submit a merge request there).
#
# BuildStream/cargo-fetcher lets GNOME's BuildStream continuous build
# service know which dependencies are required.
#
# Please update your dependencies here, then run "cargo update" to
# regenerate librsvg/Cargo.lock, and copy the resolved version numbers
# from there into cargo-fetcher/Cargo.toml.
